The first way to download and run project:
  1. Download the projects FileServer and FileSharerProject to your IDE.
  2. Run "Main.java" in FileServer to start a server.
  3. Run "Main.java" in FileSharerProject to start a client. 
  4. Now you are able to connect the client to the server, via network or locally on your computer.
  5. Enjoy!

The second way to download and run project:
  1. Checkout the svn-project
  2. Open the folder Zipped runnable jarfiles
  3. Unzip the files Server.zip and Client.zip
  4. Run the file Server.jar in the Server-folder to start a server or
  run the file Client.jar in the CLient-folder to run the client.
  5. Enjoy!
  
  *NOTE* If the second step if any reason should fail, the first way definitely works.

Very limited support for linux. Windows and Mac will work fine. We recommend Windows.
